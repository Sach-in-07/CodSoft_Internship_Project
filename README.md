# TASK 1: Movie Genre Classification
Develop a machine learning model to predict the genre of a movie based on its plot summary or other textual information. Utilize techniques such as TF-IDF or word embeddings in conjunction with classifiers like Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, or Support Vector Machines. The dataset for this task is available on Kaggle as provided by CodeSoft.

# TASK 2: Credit Card Fraud Detection
Create a model to detect fraudulent credit card transactions. Use a dataset containing credit card transaction information, and experiment with algorithms such as Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, or Random Forests to classify transactions as either fraudulent or legitimate. The dataset for this task is available on Kaggle as provided by CodeSoft.

# TASK 3: Customer Churn Prediction
Build a model to predict customer churn for a subscription-based service or business. Utilize historical customer data, including features like usage behavior and customer demographics, and apply algorithms like Logistic Regression, Random Forests, or Gradient Boosting to predict churn. The dataset for this task is available on Kaggle as provided by CodeSoft.

# TASK 4: Spam SMS Detection
Develop an AI model to classify SMS messages as spam or legitimate. Use techniques such as TF-IDF or word embeddings with classifiers like Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, or Support Vector Machines to identify spam messages. The dataset for this task is available on Kaggle as provided by CodeSoft.
